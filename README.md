# 🌊 OceanLink — Maritime Logistics Intelligence Use Cases

**OceanLink** is an end-to-end **Maritime Logistics Intelligence Platform** built on **Snowflake Intelligence (Cortex Agent)**.  
It unifies multimodal maritime data — from IoT telemetry, weather forecasts, voyage operations, and maintenance logs — to deliver real-time operational insights, predictive maintenance, and smarter voyage planning.

---

## 🚢 Overview

Modern maritime logistics faces three critical challenges:
1. **Multimodal Data Integration** – Data comes in diverse formats (PDFs, images, audio logs, IoT streams) and resides in silos.  
2. **Shipment Efficiency & Delay Optimization** – Difficult to pinpoint root causes of delays across cargo, weather, and port operations.  
3. **Predictive Maintenance & Asset Health** – Hard to correlate IoT signals and maintenance logs to detect early warning signs.  

**OceanLink** solves these with a unified Snowflake ecosystem — ingesting, transforming, and analyzing all operational data in one secure, AI-powered platform.

## ⚙️ Key Components

### 🧭 Voyage Operations
- **Data:** Shipment Schedules, Fuel Logs, Financial Expenditures, IoT Telemetry, Customer Complaints  
- **Insights:**  
  - Route performance and vessel utilization  
  - Fuel efficiency and voyage delay analytics  
  - Correlation between weather and operational risk  

### 🌦 Weather Observation
- **Data:** Weather Forecasts, Weather Observations
- **Insights:**  
  - Real-time and historical weather trends  
  - Correlation between weather risk and voyage delays  
  - Predictive weather-based rerouting potential  

### ⚓ Asset Health
- **Data:** Maintenance Checks, Maintenance Logs, Crew Audio Reports, Incident Reports, Cargo Container Condition Checking
- **Insights:**  
  - Early detection of mechanical issues  
  - Root cause analysis of recurring maintenance  
  - Predictive maintenance triggers from IoT patterns

## 🧠 Cortex AI Orchestration

OceanLink uses **three Cortex Analysts** for intelligent orchestration:

| Analyst | Focus Area | Example Question |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Voyage Operations Analyst** | Efficiency, delay, and utilization | “How did weather affect voyage delays last quarter?” |
| **Asset Health Analyst** | Machine performance, incident patterns | “Why do vibration spikes occur before failure reports?” |
| **Weather Observations Analyst** | Risk modeling & environmental forecasting | “When are high-risk weather conditions most likely to occur in each region?” |

### 🔁 Orchestration Flow
1. **Weather Observation Analyst** identifies risk patterns and forecasts.  
2. **Voyage Operations Analyst** correlates those conditions to shipping delays.  
3. **Asset Health Analyst** investigates underlying vessel or machinery causes.  

This creates a natural analytical flow — from **environmental conditions → operational impact → asset reliability**.

## 🧩 Solution Architecture

**Phases:**
1. **Ingestion:** Load structured, semi-structured (JSON) and unstructured data (Image, PDF, Audio) into Snowflake.  
2. **Transformation:** Standardize formats and unify all loaded data into structured format. 
3. **Analysis:** Query and visualize data using Snowflake Intelligence (Cortex Agents). 
4. **Output:** Chatbot Snowflake Intelligence (Cortex Agents) & Send Summary Conversations to Email.

## 📈 List of Questions Used for these Demo Use Cases

1. What is the current status of all ongoing shipments — including which vessels are active, delayed, or completed — within Oct 2025?
2. How do delay durations correlate with weather risk index, departure port, and cargo load utilization — and what patterns explain why certain vessels face longer disruptions than others?
3. Can you help to give me a forecast or a suggestion on what time i should make a shipping schedule on 27 - 28 Oct 2025 based on past weather data and the forecasted weather data - give me the reasons as to why you think its the optimal window, based on past and the forecasted weather data?
4. How does cargo condition at arrival compare to its departure inspection results — and why are certain routes showing higher rates of cargo damage or seal breaches?
5. Why are certain crew-reported issues not reflected in the maintenance logs or IoT alerts?
6. Can you send summary email from our past conversations
